Today, I embarked on a quest, a task at hand,
Without much thought or a plan so grand.
I did not confer with my team, you see,
Nor ponder the solution's feasibility.

This led to results not meeting the eye,
A lesson learned, on communication, I rely.
To grasp the task, iterate and infer,
Implement with logic, let no doubts occur.

In this tale of tasks, a lesson is found,
In dialogue and planning, success is bound.
A reminder stark, in every action we model,
The importance of communication, we acknowledge and coddle.
