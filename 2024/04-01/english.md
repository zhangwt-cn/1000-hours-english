I see you're feeling restless, always in a hurry,
Your efficiency's low, your mind's all blurry.
After much thought, you've come to understand,
Patience is key, to effectively command.

Slow down your pace, let calmness take its stead,
Focus on the process, not the outcome instead.
With patience at your side, and haste put to rest,
You'll achieve your goals, and perform at your best.
