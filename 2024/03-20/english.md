Learning's an evolution of the self, indeed,
A journey where commitment takes the lead.
With every ounce of effort that we feed,
A transformation blooms from every seed.

The more complex the content, wider the web,
A sprawling network of knowledge to ebb.
This maze is where many a mind will throb,
Continuous effort, focus on the job.

Since leaving college, time seems to compress,
Active learning lessens under stress.
Mostly passive, with dwindling zest,
A driving force of learning now suppressed.

Time wasted, in vast amounts, it's confessed,
A reminder to reignite our quest.
For knowledge and growth should never rest,
In this lifelong journey to be our best.
