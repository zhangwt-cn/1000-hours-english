Over the past few[^1] days of practicing English, the daily[^2] routine[^3] has been roughly[^4] the same[^5]. I break a piece[^] of text into several sentences, then check the pronunciation of each word within those sentences against[^7] Google Translate and the Cambridge[^8] Dictionary[^9]. This checking process is integrated[^10] throughout the entire practice session, because I often forget pronunciations or pronounce them inaccurately[^11]. Each sentence requires repeated practice, and it takes about an hour to be able to read the entire text through somewhat smoothly[^12]. With the remaining[^13] time, I repeatedly read the full text aloud to correct the pronunciation, and after several readings, I have memorized[^14] the entire passage.
