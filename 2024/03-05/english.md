Over the past few days of practicing English, the daily routine has been roughly the same. I break a piece of text into several sentences, then check the pronunciation of each word within those sentences against Google Translate and the Cambridge Dictionary. This checking process is integrated throughout the entire practice session, because I often forget pronunciations or pronounce them inaccurately. Each sentence requires repeated practice, and it takes about an hour to be able to read the entire text through somewhat smoothly. With the remaining time, I repeatedly read the full text aloud to correct the pronunciation, and after several readings, I have memorized the entire passage.
