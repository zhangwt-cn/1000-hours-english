Dreaming of things far beyond my **grasp** `/ɡræsp/`, in **whispers** `/ˈwɪs.pɚ/` to myself, I often ask.


But when I wake, reality's clear, facing the truth, with no one near `/nɪr/`.


Not all-powerful, nor a hero in tales, just an **ordinary** `/ˈɔːr.dən.er.i/` soul with its own trails `/treɪl/`.

Can't leap to the skies in a single bound, must build my path from the ground.


We tend to overrate **our** **own** case, perhaps I don't yet deserve `/dɪˈzɝːv/` that place.

A journey of steps, both large and small, toward `/tɔːrd/` the dreams that enthrall `/ɪnˈθrɑːl/`.
