Dreaming of things far beyond my grasp, in whispers to myself, I often ask.
But when I wake, reality's clear, facing the truth, with no one near.
Not all-powerful, nor a hero in tales, just an ordinary soul with its own trails.
Can't leap to the skies in a single bound, must build my path from the ground.
We tend to overrate our own case, perhaps I don't yet deserve that place.
A journey of steps, both large and small, toward the dreams that enthrall.
