I am | a Java | developer | with | 5 years | of **experience**.
[ai æm ə ˈʤɑː.və dɪˈvɛləpər wɪθ faɪv jɪərz əv ɪkˈspɪriəns]

 I | enjoy reading | in my spare time |, and recently|, I have | been reading 'How to Read a Book.' 
 
 This book **divides** `/dɪˈvaɪdz/` reading `/ˈriːdɪŋ/ ` into four **levels**  `/fɔːr ˈlɛvəlz/` and **categorizes** `/ˈkætəɡəˌraɪzɪz/`  books into **different** types, such as **practical** `/ˈpræktɪkəl/` and **literary** `/ˈlɪtərəri/` books. 
 
 
 Each type of book has a different theme and requires a different reading method. 
 
 
 When reading, one needs to progress `/ˈprɑː.gres/` from the lower levels to the higher levels step by step. 
 
 
 In the process of **progressing**, the reader will discover whether the book is worth reading.
