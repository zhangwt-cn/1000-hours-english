In the realm of design, where software architects dwell,
Lies a world of styles, each with a story to tell.
Data flows like rivers, in a stream so vast,
Networking models, where its use is cast.

Centered around data, a style stands proud,
Where information's king, and not just a cloud.
The virtual machine, a mimic of might,
Where abstraction's the key, in the software's flight.

Components stand alone, in the independent style,
Each a sovereign state, for a while.
Process control governs the procedural spree,
Guiding the operations, as smooth as can be.

But these styles, in isolation, seldom do stand,
For the architect's vision is often more grand.
Mixed and matched, they come to life,
Serving the scenarios, through the strife.

So when you build, in this architectural game,
Remember, no single style, always claims the fame.
Adapt and combine, as the context dictates,
For in versatility, true mastery awaits.
