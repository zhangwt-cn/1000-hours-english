Today is Sunday, and the sunny weather makes me feel good. I tried to transfer USDT into Kraken today, use Kraken to exchange for euros, and then withdraw the euros to Wise. The entire process has very low fees, about half of what bank international transfer fees would be, making it a very good way to withdraw money. The lazy weekend vibe makes me feel very happy, but it's a pity that the weekend is about to end.
