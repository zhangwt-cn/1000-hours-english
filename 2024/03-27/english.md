Lately, my view on learning's been profound,
Thought it was talent where my limits were found.
But now I see it's about the time and focus I bring,
Tough topics need more than a fleeting fling.

It takes enough input to see the output grow,
And complex knowledge is like a web, it flows.
It requires depth to start, to see the gains show,
Only then does the breadth of understanding glow.

So, it's not just talent, but the effort we sow,
In time and concentration, for knowledge to bestow.
