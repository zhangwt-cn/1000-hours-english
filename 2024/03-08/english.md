Today, it took so long, a challenge once known,
**Resolved** it before, yet the method wasn't shown.
I thought once conquered, no need to jot or mark,
But today proved me wrong, as I **stumbled** in the dark.

Recording's not just writing, it's wisdom on a page,
A collection of **experiences**, growing with age.
Not just to remember, but to reduce the strain,
A way to look back, and not **struggle** in vain.

So from now on, I'll keep my victories in sight,
A log of my journey, to make future battles light.
For in each note taken, there's knowledge to gain,
An **arsenal** of insights, to ease the pain.
