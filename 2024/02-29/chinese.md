我的1000小时英语计划是这样规划的，每天5点起床练习英语，但是最近由于改变的作息时间，每天早上的练习时间不足于三个小时，于是我在晚上下班之后会练习一个小时左右，今天已经是第四天了，相比于第一天我练习一个句子的时间缩短了些许，当然也可能是句子简单，不管怎么样至少经过练习我脑子回不时闪过练习过的句子并能够说出来，或许等我练习了足够多的素材就能踏入英文世界的大门

My 1000-hour English plan is organized like this: I wake up at 5 a.m. every day to practice English, but recently, due to changes in my schedule, my practice time in the morning has been less than three hours. Therefore, I practice for about an hour after work in the evening. Today is already the fourth day, and compared to the first day, the time it takes me to practice a sentence has shortened slightly, which might be because the sentences are simpler. Regardless, at least after practicing, sentences I have worked on occasionally flash through my mind, and I am able to speak them out. Perhaps once I have practiced enough material, I will be able to step through the gate into the English-speaking world.
