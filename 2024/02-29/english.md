My 1000-hour English plan is organized like this: I wake up at 5 a.m. every day to practice  English, but recently, due to changes in my **schedule** , my practice time in the morning has been less than three hours. 


Therefore, I practice for about an hour after work in the evening. Today is already the fourth day, and compared to the first day, the time it takes me to
 practice a sentence  has shortened slightly , which might be because the sentences are simpler. 


Regardless , at least after **practicing**, sentences I have worked on **occasionally** flash through my mind, and I am able to speak them out. 

Perhaps once I have practiced enough material , I will be able to step through the gate into the English-speaking world.
