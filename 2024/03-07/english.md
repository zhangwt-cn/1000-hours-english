Aware it's wrong, yet self-control slips away,
Acting on knowledge, a battle each day.
I aim for actions meaningful and bright,
Shunning empty pleasures out of sight.

"Time's exclusivity," a phrase so keen,
Time spent without gain is forever unseen.
Now I grasp the fleeting, as it has always been,
Like a swift horse passing, unseen, serene.

Lost is not just time, but what it could yield,
A harvest of gains from a well-sown field.
Understanding this, to time's pressure, I won't yield,
For its value is immense, once properly revealed.
