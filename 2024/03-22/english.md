Today I delved into game theory's lore,
Finding life's full of its concepts and more.
Many thoughts I've had align with its core,
For a game to exist, there must be two to explore.

This truth in our lives is vividly seen,
Like in chess, where strategies and wits convene.
This knowledge guides us through life's routine,
Seeking the best path, keeping our hands clean.

In every situation, we find our stance,
Making moves in life's intricate dance.
With game theory's light, we advance,
Maximizing gains with every chance.
