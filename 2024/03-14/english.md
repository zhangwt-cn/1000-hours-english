In pondering the essence of life's scene,
We're but specks in the cosmic sheen,
Trivial in the universe's vast embrace,
Yet feeling central in our personal space.

Ignoring reality, without a solid reason,
Feeling down when outcomes commit treason,
This may be our life's initial quest,
To know ourselves, and try our best.

Understanding, some things we can't direct,
We must flow with the tide, and not neglect,
To live in the moment, is the wisdom we earn,
A crucial step in life, for us to learn.
