I read a book, "Thinking, Fast and Slow," a title to note,
Discussing phenomena, intriguing thoughts it brought afloat.
The brain's odd task, complex versus simple's race,
Recognizing a face or a math case.

The simpler seems harder, yet the reverse is true,
Like identifying a friend from a fleeting view.
Language learning, akin to this recognition game,
Only through ample study, a transformation can we claim.

A journey of words, where repetition is the tool,
Transforming the complex into something cool.
So we learn, adapt, and in knowledge, we immerse,
Making the intricate simple, through the universe of verse.
