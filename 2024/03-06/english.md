Through the pages of a book on social engineering,
I learned of tactics, dark and pioneering.
Scripted hacks, the lowest form, it's clear,
Yet the book's aim, to defend, draws near.

Examples abound, exploiting human flaws,
Compassion, distress, in these weaknesses it claws.
It's in seeking help that victims find,
A trust misplaced, a hacker's mind.

So let us guard, with vigilance and care,
Against the traps laid bare, we must beware.
For in the knowledge of the games they play,
We find the power to keep the wolves at bay.
