When I think back to the age I should have studied, filled with regret for what I've missed,
The beauty of youth has faded, a chapter I've sadly dismissed.
Yet, in learning, life's direction I start to spy,
Living day by day, with only age to signify, brings no other high.
Perhaps life was meant to be this bright, breaking past the former me,
Setting no limits, in sight,
English was my weakest link, you see,
But I've made up my mind, in 2024, to express myself in English, finally free.
