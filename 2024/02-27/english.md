When I think back to the age I should have **studied**, filled with **regret** for what I've **missed**,


The **beauty** `/ˈbjuː.t̬i/` of **youth** `/juːθ/` has **faded** `/ˈfeɪ.dɪd/`, a chapter `/ˈtʃæp.tɚ/` I've **sadly** `/ˈsæd.li/` dismissed.


Yet `/jet/`, in learning, life's direction I start to spy,
Living day by day, with only age to signify `/ˈsɪɡ.nə.faɪ/`, brings no other high.


Perhaps `/pɚˈhæps/` life was meant to be this bright `/braɪt/`, breaking past the former me,

Setting no limits, in sight `/saɪt/`,
English was my weakest link, you see,
But I've made `/meɪd/` up my mind `/maɪnd/`, in 2024, to express `/ɪkˈspres/` myself in English, finally `/ˈfaɪ.nəl.i/` free.
