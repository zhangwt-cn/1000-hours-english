Exploring the essence of things is tough, like wandering in darkness, not knowing if the path's enough. Loneliness often leads to despair, making one question if it's worth it to dare. Before the dawn's light breaks through, who knows if the path we choose is true? Only when the end is near, can we see our success clear. Facing the heart within us all, is how we stand tall and walk from the night into the light, never giving up the fight. This journey of exploration, a path to our soul's elevation, is the only way to understand life's true foundation.
