This morning's English drill was a hit to the thrill,
A word I tried, sixty times, yet it gave me the chill.
Confusion and helplessness, in my mind, they spill,
Wondering if it's talent I lack, or just a bump in the hill.

But after pondering deep, with a strong, steadfast will,
I chose to persist, let no doubt or fear instill.
For the harder the climb, the more I must fulfill,
Believing in light beyond darkness, an unwavering thrill.

So let's not doubt our worth, or our minds with worry fill,
The journey's tough, but our spirits, they can't kill.
With every fall, we'll rise, more skilled,
For in the face of adversity, our dreams, we'll still distill.
