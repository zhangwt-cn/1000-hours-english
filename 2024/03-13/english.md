On the subway ride, a phenomenon quite fine,
Most choose the lift, in a lengthy line.
Even stairs, not daunting in their climb,
Seems effort's not a penny, but a dime.

Perhaps it's our minds, subtly in command,
Guiding us to what seems a softer land.
A shortcut's allure, like a siren's song,
Makes one ponder if they're right or wrong.

So in learning and living, let's be aware,
Of the easy paths that seem to glare.
For growth and strength, in their silent plea,
Often lie in steps, not seen but free.
