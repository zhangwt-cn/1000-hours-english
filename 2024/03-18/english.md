In learning English, new words create a wall,
A significant barrier, making us feel small.
But as these words begin to repeat,
In articles we read, a feat quite neat.

Reminds me of swimming, with fear of the pool,
Feeling its vastness, a daunting tool.
Yet, as skills improve, the pool seems to shrink,
In repetition, we find the link.

Just like swimming, with practice and time,
Mastering English, climbing the climb.
Repetition, the key, in all we do,
To conquer the language, and swim through.
